Example of executing PythonTutor using Quarto below.

```{pythontutor}
def foo(x, y):
    if not x:
        return 0
    z = x-1
    return x + foo(z, y)

foo(2,3)
```

## Another program


```{pythontutor}
def foo(x, y):
  return x * y

foo(2,3)
```

This is just to ensure that two programs can co-exist.

## Todo list

- [ ] Fix the strange rendering of arrows
- [ ] Fix the strange rendering of the step slider (some sort of cursor above the buttons)
- [ ] Style it nicely (ugly HTML default buttons!)
- [ ] Fix strange rendering of line arrows (does it rely on absolute positioning?)
